I have a list of cyber threat-related terms collected from industry sources. I want to extract only those terms that specifically refer to types of cyberattacks or malicious techniques. Please filter the list to include only the entries that represent cyberattack types or specific threat behaviors. Additionally, if the list lacks any newly emerged or commonly used attack types, please add them based on your knowledge of current cybersecurity threats.
